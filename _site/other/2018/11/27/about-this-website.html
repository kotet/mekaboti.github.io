            <p>This post is for people who visited while I’m creating this website. This website isn’t completed yet. But I thought it’s not good that I say nothing here so I wrote this post.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-website">about this website</h2>
<p>This website is about language learning and computer technologies mainly but I plan to write also other things,too.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-this-site">the future of this site</h2>
<p>I plan to add some more functions to this website. Now this site has only three categories,exactly 2 categories but I’d like to add more. And about this post page, now this page cant be said it’s easy to read so I’ll make here better.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">about me</h2>
<p>Im a student of university and I major Spanish language and regions that Spanish language is spoken but I also study about computers and some other languages,too. So,you can’t expect me to say something good about computer but about language you can.</p>
